/** Represent Thing on KiiCloud. There are two types of property of KiiThing, reserve and custom.
 
 <h3>Reserve Fields</h3>

 Reserve keys can not be used as the key of <[KiiBaseObject setObject:forKey:]> methods of KiiThing.

 To set/get the value of these reserve fields, you use the property accessor of these field.
 
 - _thingID
 - _vendorThingID
 - _password
 - _thingType
 - _vendor
 - _firmwareVersion
 - _productName
 - _lot
 - _created
 - _stringField1
 - _stringField2
 - _stringField3
 - _stringField4
 - _stringField5
 - _numberField1
 - _numberField2
 - _numberField3
 - _numberField4
 - _numberField5
 - _accessToken
 
 
 <h3>Custom Fields</h3>
 
 
 Custom field includes any field choose by you, other than reserve field.
 
 Custom field can have NString, NSNumber type values and collections (NSArray/NSDictionary) contains NSString/NSNumber.
 
 Setter/getter (<[KiiBaseObject setObject:forKey:]> , <[KiiBaseObject getObjectForKey:]> ) method of these type can be used to set/get the custom field.
 
 @note KiiThing does not support removal of fields from Server.
